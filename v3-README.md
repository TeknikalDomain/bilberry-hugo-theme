## Teknikal_Domain's Modified Fork of the Bilberry Hugo Theme
This is a fork of Lednerb's theme for [HUGO](https://gohugo.io), which itself is inspired by the [Lingonberry WordPress](http://www.andersnoren.se/teman/lingonberry-wordpress-theme/) theme from Anders Nor√©n.

## Changes

As this is a local-to-me branch, there's a number of differences that aren't upstream:

### Functionality

- Ability to embed Google Charts diagrams in posts.
- Littlefoot(link pending) library for better footnotes.
- Add a narration file for users to listen to instead of reading the post, with keyboard shortcut.

- Mastodon "rel=me" link support.
- Ko-fi donations button.
- MathJax block math, allow escapes.

- Underline links in post content.
